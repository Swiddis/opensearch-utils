# Swiddis's OpenSearch Utils

This repository is a collection of utility scripts I use for working on the OpenSearch project.

I make no general guarantees for stability or usability, but I think there's some generally helpful
stuff in here, like a hackable docker compose file for development, a release note autogenerator,
and a recursive git utility script.

Generally I'll try to only push stuff to main if it's in a working state, and use other branches for
more experimental stuff.
